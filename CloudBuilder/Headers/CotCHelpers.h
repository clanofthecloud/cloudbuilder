	/**
	 * Base class indicating a reference-counted object. The rules are as follow:
	 * - When creating an object (with 'new' or from a factory method, stating that the return value is owned by you), you need to call Release() when you are done.
	 * - In other cases, the object is just passed to you as a reference and will be released by its owner. If you would like to keep the object for longer than the scope of the current method (typically, when assigning to a class member), call Retain() on it and then Release() when you don't need it anymore.
	 *
	 * Once all the owners have called Release() (the original one which created it as well as all those which called Retain()) the object can be destroyed.
	 *
	 * Technically, the object starts with a reference count of 1, calling Release() decrements the count, calling Retain() increments it. When reaching zero, the object is destroyed.
	 *
	 * Example: \code
		class C: public CRefClass {
			A *member;

			C(A *a) {
				member = a;
				member->Retain();		// Take ownership
			}
			~C() {
				member->Release();
			}
			A *getMember() {
				return member;			// Getter so no need to make the caller owner
			}
			void setMember(A *newMember) {
				member->Release();		// Release the original member
				member = newMember;		// Assign the new one
				member->Retain();		// And take ownership on the new one
			}
		};

		C *c = new C(...);
		A *a = c.getMember();
		c->Release();			// Release what we created, not 'a' which we don't own \endcode
		*
		* Note: you may also create CRefClass'es on the stack. In that case, the original creator shall not call Release() (other objects which have called Retain() may though, as they don't know how the variable was created).
		* The following will work as expected: \code
		void func(C *pointer) {
			// This function is unaware of how the object was created so it can Retain/Release it...
			pointer->Retain();
			...
			pointer->Release();
		}
		C var;
		func(&var);
		// No need to call var.Release() as it was created on the stack \endcode
		*
		* An exception saying "Freeing an object that is still retained elsewhere" can be triggered if you delete an object without using Release(). This can also happen implicitly when using the stack, as in the following example: \code
		struct A: public CRefClass { ... };
		struct B {
			A *member;
			~B() { member->Release(); }
			void setMember(A *newMember) {
				member = newMember, member->Retain();
			}
			void useMember() {
				member->doMethod();
			}
		};
		B b;
		{
			A a;
			b.setMember(&a);
		}
		b.useMember();			// exception \endcode
		*
		* In this example, the object A is destroyed by the compiler as we reach the end of the block, but it is still retained in B. This is why it is highly recommended not to create CRefClass'es on the stack except for local use.

	 * This smart pointer can optionally be used to automate the Retain/Release work on CRefClass objects.
	 * Calling Autorelease(obj) will create an autoref<Type> which will hold the object and call Release on it when it goes out of scope.
	 * Building an autoref<Type>(obj) will Retain the object upon creation and Release it when it goes out of scope.
	 * - If you are going to be the owner of the object (case of a return value or new Object) and want to release it when it goes out of scope, use Autorelease(obj).
	 * - If you are not the owner of the object and just want to keep a reference (case of a parameter) use autoref<Type>(obj).
	 * Example:
		C *c = new C();
		autoref<C> cRef = Autorelease(c);		// Will call Release once when cRef goes out of scope, freeing the object
		// But, if you pass as a parameter, you will probably want this instead

		autoref<A> a1 = c.getMember();
