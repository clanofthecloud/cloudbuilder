	/** The CIndexManager class is used to index and search for objects (e.g. matches, players, ?).

		The index is global to a domain (or your game if private, as usual), therefore all data is
		shared by all players.
		
		You can index arbitrary data and then look for it using either the properties or the
		payload. The properties are indexed, while the payload is only returned in the results.

		For instance, if you would like to look for matches using certain criteria, such as only
		"public" matches involving "team B", you will not store these properties in the matches
		themselves since they are not indexed, but instead index the matches under a "matches"
		index, along with these properties, and then perform a query to find them. Note that you
		may need server-side hooks in order to keep the index updated as the match gets modified
		(if you are indexing, for instance, the number of players, you will want to override the
		match-join and match-leave events). Refer to the server documentation for more info.
