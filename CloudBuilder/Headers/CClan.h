			@param	aConfiguration is a JSON object holding the necessary connection details.
			The mandatory keys are:
			 - "key": string containing the community key.
			 - "secret": string containing the community secret.
			 - "env": string containing the environment. Currently, "sandbox" (testing environment)
			   and "prod" (production environment) are supported.

			The optional keys are:
			- "appFolder": used with the default CFileSystemHandler to set the folder in which
			  the data will be saved. On Windows, it would be %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\<appFolder>\.
			- "autoresume" : boolean to control if after a Setup the system has to proceed an automatic resumesession when possible.
			- "autoRegisterForNotification": by default, RegisterForNotification is called right after login.
			  By setting this key to 'false', you can manage when you want to register for notifications by
			  calling the CUserManager::RegisterForNotification at your convenience.
			- "connectTimeout": sets a custom timeout allowed when connecting to the servers. Defaults to 5.
			- "httpTimeout": sets a custom timeout for all requests. Defaults to no limit.
			- "eventLoopTimeout": sets a custom timeout for the long polling event loop. Should be used with care and set to a
			  high value (at least 60). Defaults to 590.
			- "httpVerbose": set to true to output detailed information about the requests performed to CotC servers. Can be used
			  for debugging, though it will pollute the logs very much.
			@param handler result handler whenever the call finishes (it might also be synchronous)
			@result if noErr, the json passed to the handler may contain:
			{ "_error" : 0}

		 *
		 * In this "mode", requests are still executed serially (meaning that any request -- API call -- that was
		 * issued later on is only executed after success or failure of the previous). However, in case of failure,
		 * the request is not re-attempted automatically, instead the callback is called. From this callback, you
		 * can decide to either retry the request later, or abort it. Aborting it has the effect of allowing the
		 * next request to proceed.
		 *
		 * There is an exception with the domain event loop which is run once logged in. The behaviour of this
		 * loop cannot be altered, the callback is not called and the request will be retried anyway.
		 *
		 * Also note that the callback is only invoked upon retriable error (network related). If the server
		 * returns a non-recoverable error code or there is an error with an argument, the API call will fail
		 * immediately.
		 *
		 * @param aCallback the callback to be called whenever a request fails. Unlike all other uses of the
		 * delegates, this one can be called multiple times. Memory is managed by the library, that is the
		 * callback is freed when not in use anymore (additional call to this method or Terminate).
