# CloudBuilder
Native C++ SDK for Clan of the Cloud

## Downloading and installing

Download the desired version (either in .7z form, requiring 7-zip to decompress, or in .zip form) from the [releases page](https://github.com/clanofthecloud/cloudbuilder/releases) below.

Then, start with [the documentation](http://xtralifecloud.github.io/cloudbuilder/) in order to start integrating the SDK in your own application.

This SDK works with Clan of the Cloud. For more information and configuring your application, visit http://www.clanofthecloud.com/. Note that we also provide a [Unity SDK](https://github.com/clanofthecloud/unity-sdk), which is much easier to get started with.

## Compiling

Compiling is rather complicated and if you simply want to use the library, we encourage you to start by downloading a precompiled version of the SDK from the releases page.

In order to compile, you need the delivery directory. You can obtain it by checking out the `cloudbuilder-tools` repository and putting it side-by-side with the cloudbuilder repository on your local machine. Compiling all the sub-projects will put their results ready for use in a directory cloudbuilder-tools/../cloudbuilder/delivery.

In order to get started quickly, you can download a precompiled version on the Google Drive. These files may be updated often, last versions are currently dated from Mon, Sep 19 of 2016.
You can download directly from here the [7z version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-e4O9N2eTBhNWROem9ibkdScVk/view?usp=sharing) or the [zip version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-e4O9N2eTBhTlROQ2tBU1lfWFE/view?usp=sharing)

The CLI project is used for testing and debugging, more instructions will be coming soon. Stay tuned!
